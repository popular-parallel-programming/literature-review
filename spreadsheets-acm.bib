Office software, such as the ubiquitous spreadsheet, provides customization facilities, while the growth of the Web has added impetus to end-user scripting for interactive functions in Web sites. In scientific and engineering domains, end users frequently develop complex systems with standard programming languages such as C++ and Java. However, only a minority of users adapt commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software products. Indeed, composing systems from reusable components, such as enterprise resource planing (ERP) systems, defeats most end users who resort to expensive and scarce expert developers for implementation.},

Some examples of successful EUD concepts include spreadsheet and word processing macros and the specification of e-mail filters by means of rules. Recent developments, such as Web 2.0 and Semantic Web, which enable end users to be contributors rather than just consumers of information on the WWW, have renewed interest in EUD research and applications. This trend is now moving from content and personalization to functionality in the direction of user-generated web services. Various on-going projects are already considering this new trend, but primarily from a technology perspective. The workshop aims at establishing a new forum for discussion and fruitful cross-fertilization of ideas among all the communities that can contribute to and benefit from allowing end users to generate web services: human-computer interaction, software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer-supported cooperative work and innovation management.},

  abstract = 	 {Commercial relational database systems lack support for complex business modeling. ANSI SQL cannot treat relations as multidimensional arrays and define multiple, interrelated formulas over them, operations which are needed for business modeling. Relational OLAP (ROLAP) applications have to perform such tasks using joins, SQL Window Functions, complex CASE expressions, and the GROUP BY operator simulating the pivot operation. The designated place in SQL for calculations is the SELECT clause, which is extremely limiting and forces the user to generate queries with nested views, subqueries and complex joins. Furthermore, SQL query optimizers are preoccupied with determining efficient join orders and choosing optimal access methods and largely disregard optimization of multiple, interrelated formulas. Research into execution methods has thus far concentrated on efficient computation of data cubes and cube compression rather than on access structures for random, interrow calculations. This has created a gap that has been filled by spreadsheets and specialized MOLAP engines, which are good at specification of formulas for modeling but lack the formalism of the relational model, are difficult to coordinate across large user groups, exhibit scalability problems, and require replication of data between the tool and RDBMS. This article presents an SQL extension called SQL Spreadsheet, to provide array calculations over relations for complex modeling. We present optimizations, access structures, and execution models for processing them efficiently. Special attention is paid to compile time optimization for expensive operations like aggregation. Furthermore, ANSI SQL does not provide a good separation between data and computation and hence cannot support parameterization for SQL Spreadsheets models. We propose two parameterization methods for SQL. One parameterizes ANSI SQL view using subqueries and scalars, which allows passing data to SQL Spreadsheet. Another method presents parameterization of the SQL Spreadsheet formulas. This supports building stand-alone SQL Spreadsheet libraries. These models are then subject to the SQL Spreadsheet optimizations during model invocation time.},

Hence they proposed a way to define a function in terms of a worksheet with designated input and output cells; we shall call it a function sheet. The goal of our work is to develop implementations of function sheets and study their application to realistic examples. Therefore, we are also developing a simple yet comprehensive spreadsheet core implementation for experimentation with this technology. Here we report briefly on our experiments with function sheets as well as other uses of our spreadsheet core implementation.},

However, as the literature indicates, a significant proportion of spreadsheet programs contain faults. One of the contributing factors to the quality issue is the invisibility of cell dependencies (which define the dataflow structure of a spreadsheet) up on which computations are performed. In an attempt to provide a guide in understanding spreadsheets, this paper presents an approach to visualize a spreadsheet in terms of logical areas using the MCL (Markov Clustering) algorithm. Instead of focusing their attention on the whole spreadsheet, spreadsheet users may narrow their focus to one logical area at a time. To evaluate our approach, a prototype tool has been developed and integrated into Microsoft Excel.},

While this may sound bizarre, Excel's flexibility and convenience renders it an immensely useful tool for the Front Office, and our Traders are extremely Excel literate. Excel combines two programming models a zeroth order functional language (the spreadsheet) an imperative programming language (Visual Basic for Applications) The functional model allows very rapid development and great transparency, but the limitations of Excel's built-in functions drives developers to use VBA. Soon the spreadsheet dependency graph is lost and the spreadsheet layer is relegated to a GUI on top of tens/hundreds of thousands of lines of VBA. The logic is tightly tied to Excel, and a server-side implementation involves a complete rewrite in another language, which carries both operational risk and developmental cost. FMD ('Functional Model Deployment') prevents these problems by embedding a functional language cleanly into Excel, effectively extending Excel to be a higher order functional environment. Now complex models can be developed without leaving the pure spreadsheet domain: Before 1.Limited built-in functions need to be extended with add-ins or VBA. 2.Boilerplate code needs to be written to import libraries. 3.Systems need to be rewritten to run outside Excel. (typically ported to C++ / C# back end) After 1.Functions can be defined on-the-fly without leaving the pure spreadsheet side. 2.Dynamic and data-driven wrappers make external libraries directly visible. 3.Spreadsheet 'programs' can be exported and run outside of Excel. The business have fully supported this approach, and are enthusiastic about using FMD - as Simon Peyton Jones identified elsewhere, "Excel is the world's most popular functional language". From their point of view, functional programming in Excel is just an extension of what they've been doing for years!},

From the oldest spreadsheet to the most modern database, end users and administrators alike have interacted with tabular data. Usually, each concept is represented by a table and columns. Change to the structure of each concept requires structural change to the tables and columns, which is costly. Tailor-made database and web applications may overcome this obstacle by designing UIs on top of the data layer, providing some degree of data independence. However, changes in their schemas do not automatically propagate into the user interface, and so their maintenance is expensive. In this paper we present a user interface that lets the end user alter the schema without the need for programming skills, eliminating the need for expensive software maintenance. To this end we propose an automatically generated user interface to include schema and data management functions. We built and evaluated an Adaptive Information System user interface (AIS UI), incorporating schema evolution functionality. In usability testing, first-time users were able to perform various data management tasks equally fast or faster than users using Microsoft Access, and on average ~43\% faster than users using Microsoft Excel. Task completion rates using the AIS significantly exceeded those using Microsoft Access and were comparable (>95\%) with those using Microsoft Excel.},

However, the spreadsheet paradigm of computation still lacks sufficient analysis. In this paper we demonstrate that a spreadsheet can play the role of a relational database engine, without any use of macros or built-in programming languages, merely by utilizing spreadsheet formulas. We achieve that by implementing all operators of relational algebra by means of spreadsheet functions. Given a definition of a database in SQL, it is therefore possible to construct a spreadsheet workbook with empty worksheets for data tables and worksheets filled with formulas for queries. From then on, when the user enters, alters or deletes data in the data worksheets, the formulas in query worksheets automatically compute the actual results of the queries. Thus, the spreadsheet serves as data storage and executes SQL queries, and therefore acts as a relational database engine. The paper is based on Microsoft Excel (TM), but our constructions work in other spreadsheet systems, too. We present a number of performance tests conducted in the beta version of Excel 2010. Their conclusion is that the performance is sufficient for a desktop database with a couple thousand rows.},

Second, in a project involving the evolution of a well-established language, compatibility with previous versions is a major issue, and maintaining this compatibility was our second objective. Third and most important, the commercial success of spreadsheets is largely due to the fact that many people find them more usable than programming languages for programming-like tasks. Thus, our third objective (with resulting constraints) was to maintain this usability advantage.Simply making Excel more like a conventional programming language would not meet these objectives and constraints. We have therefore taken an approach to our design work that emphasises the cognitive requirements of the user as a primary design criterion. The analytic approach that we demonstrate in this project is based on recent developments in the study of programming usability, including the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations and the Attention Investment model of abstraction use. We believe that this approach is also applicable to the design and extension of other programming languages and environments.},

Our first objective was to bring the benefits of additional programming language features to a system that is often not recognised as a programming language. Second, in a project involving the evolution of a well-established language, compatibility with previous versions is a major issue, and maintaining this compatibility was our second objective. Third and most important, the commercial success of spreadsheets is largely due to the fact that many people find them more usable than programming languages for programming-like tasks. Thus, our third objective (with resulting constraints) was to maintain this usability advantage.Simply making Excel more like a conventional programming language would not meet these objectives and constraints. We have therefore taken an approach to our design work that emphasises the cognitive requirements of the user as a primary design criterion. The analytic approach that we demonstrate in this project is based on recent developments in the study of programming usability, including the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations and the Attention Investment model of abstraction use. We believe that this approach is also applicable to the design and extension of other programming languages and environments.},

The basic idea is to link cell ranges belonging to different spreadsheets in such a way to come up with a distributed spreadsheet. While such a behavior is already supported in private file spaces, our platform extends the operating principle and the functionality to the Internet in a secure way, using a SOA infrastructure as a communication bus. The platform consists of a client component, installed as a Plug-in in spreadsheet applications, and of a server component, accessible as a Web Service, that orchestrates the data exchanges among the client spreadsheets. One of the most original functionalities provided by the platform and described in the paper is that of guaranteeing the propagation of values along chains of linked spreadsheets even when some of the component spreadsheets are off-line. In addition to the description of the platform the paper also includes the description of a Spreadsheet Mashup framework specifically suited to hierarchical organizations such as those of enterprises. The architecture of the framework is presented in the light of a real-life example.},

This inability to conveniently go beyond numbers and strings without straying outside the spreadsheet paradigm has been a limiting factor in the applicability of spreadsheet languages. In this article we present graphical definitions, an approach that removes this limitation, allowing both simple and complex graphical objects to be programmed directly using direct manipulation and gestures, in a manner that fits seamlessly within the spreadsheet paradigm. We  also describe an empirical study, in which subjects programmed such objects faster and with fewer errors using this approach than when using a traditional approach to formula specification. Because the approach is expressive enough to be used with both built-in and user-defined types, it allows the directness of demonstrational and spreadsheet techniques to be used in programming a wider range of applications than has been possible before.},

Within spreadsheets, this approach has also been followed, namely by ClassSheets. In this paper, we propose an extension to ClassSheets to allow the specification of spreadsheets that can be viewed as relational databases. Moreover, we present a transformation from ClassSheet models to UML class diagrams enriched with OCL constraints.

This paper presents an algorithm for table recognition in spreadsheets. The algorithm uses three types of cells as its basis: title cell, header cell, and data cell. Different attributes of the cells are used to identify the cell type within a spreadsheet. Hierarchical clustering is used to aggregate cells to compose the functional components of a table. The algorithm has been evaluated on a diverse set of benchmarks with very encouraging results.},

Current APIs, however, aim toward developers with programming expertise; they are not directly usable by wider class of users who do not have programming background, but would nevertheless like to build their own mashups. To address this need, we propose a spreadsheet-based Web mashups development framework, which enables users to develop mashups in the popular spreadsheet environment. First, we provide a mechanism that makes structured data first class values of spreadsheet cells. Second, we propose a new component model that can be used to develop fairly sophisticated mashups, involving joining data sources and keeping spreadsheet data up to date. Third, to simplify mashup development, we provide a collection of spreadsheet-based mashup patterns that captures common Web data access and spreadsheet presentation functionalities. Users can reuse and customize these patterns to build spreadsheet-based Web mashups instead of developing them from scratch. Fourth, we enable users to manipulate structured data presented on spreadsheet in a drag-and-drop fashion. Finally, we have developed and tested a proof-of-concept prototype to demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework.},

Type systems have traditionally played a strong role in detecting errors in programming languages, and it is therefore reasonable to ask whether type systems could not be helpful in improving the current situation of spreadsheet programming.In this paper we introduce a type system and a type inference algorithm for spreadsheets and demonstrate how this algorithm and the underlying typing concept can identify programming errors in spreadsheets. In addition, we also demonstrate how the type inference algorithm can be employed to infer models, or specifications, for spreadsheets, which can be used to prevent future errors in spreadsheets.},

Consequently, these tools cannot automatically validate or reformat these data. To address this problem, we have developed a user-extensible model for string-like data. Each "tope" in this model is a user-defined abstraction that guides the interpretation of strings as a particular kind of data. Specifically, each tope implementation contains software functions for recognizing and reformatting instances of that tope's kind of data. This makes it possible at runtime to distinguish between invalid data, valid data, and questionable data that could be valid or invalid. Once identified, questionable and/or invalid data can be double-checked and possibly corrected, thereby increasing the overall reliability of the data. Valid data can be automatically reformatted to any of the formats appropriate for that kind of data. To show the general applicability of topes, we describe new features that topes have enabled us to provide in four tools.},

Our results show that the use of the methodology was associated with significant improvement in testing effectiveness and efficiency even with no training on the theory of testing or test adequacy that the model implements.

WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) is a GUI framework which encourages architectural separation between the layout of the user interface itself (the "View") and the underlying interactions and calculations (the "ViewModel" and "Model"). We have built a framework for developing tools in WPF that makes use of a graph-based calculation engine for implementing ViewModels and Models in F#. The engine is built on F# asynchronous workflows and provides a standard set of features to our tools. In this talk I'll discuss the implementation of this calculation engine, including various steps in its evolution that led up to our use of asynchronous workflows.

In this paper, we study this cloning in spreadsheets. Based on existing text-based clone detection algorithms, we have developed an algorithm to detect data clones in spreadsheets: formulas whose values are copied as plain text in a different location.   To evaluate the usefulness of the proposed approach, we conducted two evaluations. A quantitative evaluation in which we analyzed the EUSES corpus and a qualitative evaluation consisting of two case studies. The results of the evaluation clearly indicate that 1) data clones are common, 2) data clones pose threats to spreadsheet quality and 3) our approach supports users in finding and resolving data clones.},

  abstract = 	 {e is a programming language designed for modeling and verification of electronic systems. As such it is used extensively in the microchip industry, and was recently declared an IEEE standard, e is also a powerful general-purpose language used in the implementation of complex commercial software tools.It was suggested some time ago that a number of idioms in e resemble those of AOP, but the suggestion was never examined in depth. The present paper takes up this task. For this purpose the relevant mechanisms in e are compared with those of today's prominent aspect-oriented language - AspectJ - with respect to syntax, semantics, and application.e's aspect-oriented capabilities turn out to be a small subset of AspectJ's, but an interesting one. It is weaker in its support for implementing developmental and non-functional concerns. However, with its simpler syntax and economical semantics, e captures in a natural way crosscutting concerns that stem from the application domain. Thus, e seems to exemplify an original variant of AOP - one that is conservative and robust from a software design point of view.},

We present a factoring algorithm for identifying and extracting these components from conventional spreadsheets with minimal user intervention, and a synthesis algorithm that assists users in the construction of executable spreadsheets from reusable model components. This approach opens new possibilities for applying object-oriented and model management  techniques to support the construction, sharing, and reuse of spreadsheet models in organizations. Importantly, our approach to model management and the Windows-based prototype that we have developed are designed to coexist with, rather than replace, traditional spreadsheet programs. In other words, the users are not required to learn a new modeling language; instead, their logical models and data sets are extracted from their spreadsheets transparently, as a side-effect of using standard spreadsheet programs.},

By defining and modifying templates for various semistructured objects, users can represent information about people, tasks, products, messages, and many other kinds of information in a form that can be processed intelligently by both people and their computers. By collecting these objects in customizable folders, users can create their own displays which summarize selected information from the objects in table or tree formats. Finally, by creating semiautonomous agents, users can specify rules for automatically processing this information in different ways at different times.
The combination of these primitives provides a single consistent interface that integrates facilities for object-oriented databases, hypertext, electronic messaging, and rule-based intelligent agents. To illustrate the power of this combined approach, we describe several simple examples of applications (such as task tracking, intelligent message routing, and database retrieval) that we have developed in this framework.},

  abstract = 	 {One of the critical deficiencies of SQL is lack of support for n-dimensional array-based computations which are frequent in OLAP environments. Relational OLAP (ROLAP) applications have to emulate them using joins, recently introduced SQL Window Functions [18] and complex and inefficient CASE expressions. The designated place in SQL for specifying calculations is the SELECT clause, which is extremely limiting and forces the user to generate queries using nested views, subqueries and complex joins. Furthermore, SQL-query optimizer is pre-occupied with determining efficient join orders and choosing optimal access methods and largely disregards optimization of complex numerical formulas. Execution methods concentrated on efficient computation of a cube [11], [16] rather than on random access structures for inter-row calculations. This has created a gap that has been filled by spreadsheets and specialized MOLAP engines, which are good at formulas for mathematical modeling but lack the formalism of the relational model, are difficult to manage, and exhibit scalability problems. This paper presents SQL extensions involving array based calculations for complex modeling. In addition, we present optimizations, access structures and execution models for processing them efficiently.},

MarketingPlatform™ is a solution for marketers in direct marketing and in channel marketing who would like to gain a timely and deep understanding of what is working and what is not working in their marketing campaigns. Marketers are than facilitated in the execution and delivery of campaigns, using this insight to create relevant communications to each individual. It is divided into four tightly integrated campaign management steps of Measure, Analyze, Design and Execute. Measure: How well are my campaigns working? Are they meeting the goals? Analyze: Why are the campaigns exceeding goals, or falling short of goals? What sub-segments are worthy of further communications with? Design: Create communications that are relevant to each individual, driven by the data and insight gained from measurement and analysis. Execute: Deliver the communications through the most appropriate channels, including email, print and mail, texting and purls. Why did TFC management choose F#? F# is a functional language with first class functions and composability, a pattern matching language and strongly typed. At the same time it as a .NET CLR language, fully interoperable with the vast libraries, and fully capable of OOP. So we believed that we would get the best of both worlds --- a modern productive language and a full set of libraries to build on. The product is in the market and selling well, so we were rewarded by our decisions. Where was F# applied within the application, and where not? Most of the business logic was implemented in F#, as was most of the data handling. C# was retained for building the ASP.NET user interface, just because the F# tool support is not there yet. What were the development benefits? The application was developed in less time with significantly less code --- probably a quarter. The code is more readable and easier to adapt as new market requirements come in. What were the business benefits? We were able to get to market much sooner with more feature, and the overall cost of the development was significantly lower. Conclusion: F# is an excellent language for line of business applications. It somewhat shortens the development cycle and greatly shortens the enhancement cycle.},

  abstract = 	 {Due to the ever increasing constraints on power consumption in embedded systems, this paper addresses the need for an efficient power modeling and estimation methodology based tool at system-level. On the one hand, today's embedded industries focus more on manufacturing RISC processor-based platforms as they are cost and power effective. On the other hand, modern embedded applications are becoming more and more sophisticated and resource demanding: multimedia (H.264 encoder and decoder), software defined radio, GPS, mobile applications, etc. The main objective of this paper focuses on the scarcity of a fast power modeling and an accurate power estimation tool at the system-level for complex embedded systems. In this paper, we propose a standalone simulation tool for power estimation at system-level. As a first step, we develop the power models at the functional level. This is done by characterizing the power behavior of RISC processor based platforms across a wide spectrum of application benchmark to understand their power profile. Then, we propose power models to cost-effectively estimate its power at run-time of complex embedded applications. The proposed power models rely on a few parameters which are based on functional blocks of the processor architecture. As a second step, we propose a power estimation simulator which is based on cycle-accurate full system simulation framework. The combination of the above two steps provides a standalone power estimation tool at the system-level. The effectiveness of our proposed methodology is validated through an ARM9, an ARM Cortex-A8 and an ARM Cortex-A9 processor designed around the OMAP5912, OMAP 3530 and OMAP4430 boards respectively. The efficiency and the accuracy of our proposed tool is evaluated by using a variety of basic programs to complex benchmarks. Estimated power values are compared to real board measurements for the different processor architecture based platforms. Our obtained power estimation results provide less than 3\% of error for ARM940T processor, 2.9\% for ARM Cortex-A8 processor and 4.2\% for ARM Cortex-A9 processor based platforms when compared to the other state-of-the-art power estimation tools.},

Consequently, these tools cannot automatically validate these data. To address this problem, we have developed a new userextensible model for string-like data. Each "tope" in this model is a user-defined abstraction that guides the interpretation of strings as a particular kind of data, such as a mailing address. Specifically, each tope implementation contains software functions for recognizing and reformatting that tope's kind of data. With our tools, end-user programmers define new topes and associate them with fields in spreadsheets, webforms, and other programs. This makes it possible at runtime to distinguish between invalid data, valid data, and questionable data that could be valid or invalid. Once identified, questionable and/or invalid data can be double-checked and possibly corrected, thereby increasing the overall reliability of the data.},

We present the algorithms and their time complexities and show that, because the algorithms perform their analyses incrementally, on only the on-screen program elements rather than on the entire program, the method is scalable.

These tools make it easier to produce complex documents by using such technologies as syntax-directed or presentation-oriented editing, etc. However, when an XML document contains data with some computation dependency among them, these tools cannot free users from the burden of maintaining this dependency relationship. By computation dependency, we mean that some data are gotten by computing from other data in the same document.In this paper, we present an environment for authoring XML document, in which users can express the data dependency relationship in one document explicitly rather than implicitly in their minds. Under this environment, the dependent parts of the document are represented as expressions, which in turn can be evaluated to generate the dependent data. Therefore, users need not to compute the dependent data first and then input them manually, as required by the current authoring tools.},

Several specialized domain-specific languages and extensions of memory-unsafe languages were proposed to aid distributed system development. We present an alternative to these approaches, showing that modern, higher-order, strongly typed, memory safe languages provide an excellent vehicle for developing and debugging distributed systems. We present Opis, a functional-reactive approach for developing distributed systems in Objective Caml. An Opis protocol description consists of a reactive function (called event function) describing the behavior of a distributed system node. The event functions in Opis are built from pure functions as building blocks, composed using the Arrow combinators. Such architecture aids reasoning about event functions both informally and using interactive theorem provers. For example, it facilitates simple termination arguments. Given a protocol description, a developer can use higher-order library functions of Opis to 1) deploy the distributed system, 2) run the distributed system in a network simulator with full-replay capabilities, 3) apply explicit-state model checking to the distributed system, detecting undesirable behaviors, and 4) do performance analysis on the system. We describe the design and implementation of Opis, and present our experience in using Opis to develop peer-to-peer overlay protocols, including the Chord distributed hash table and the Cyclon random gossip protocol. We found that using Opis results in high programmer productivity and leads to easily composable protocol descriptions. Opis tools were effective in helping identify and eliminate correctness and performance problems during distributed system development.},

One recent class of methods involves linear value function approximation, where the optimal value function is assumed to be a linear combination of some set of basis functions, with the aim of finding suitable weights. While sophisticated techniques have been developed for finding the best approximation within this constrained space, few methods have been proposed for choosing a suitable basis set, or modifying it if solution quality is found wanting. We propose a general framework, and specific proposals, that address both of these questions. In particular, we examine &#60;i&#62;weakly coupled MDPs&#60;/i&#62; where a number of subtasks can be viewed independently modulo resource constraints. We then describe methods for constructing a piecewise linear combination of the subtask value functions, using greedy decision tree techniques. We argue that this architecture is suitable for many types of MDPs whose combinatorics are determined largely by the existence multiple conflicting objectives.},

These new codes now have the highest asymptotic transmission rates known for certain ranges of alphabet size and error rate. Both the theory and possible practical use of these new record codes require the development of new tools.  On the theoretical side, establishing the transmission rate depends on an error estimate for a theorem of Schanuel applied to the function field of an asymptotically optimal curve.  On the computational side, actual use of the codes will hinge on the solution of new problems in the computational algebraic geometry of curves.},

Thus, researchers are struggling with providing suitable programming languages, tools, or coding conventions to support developers in their everyday work. In this paper, we explore whether functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is well established in cognitive neuroscience, is feasible to soundly measure program comprehension. In a controlled experiment, we observed 17 participants inside an fMRI scanner while they were comprehending short source-code snippets, which we contrasted with locating syntax errors. We found a clear, distinct activation pattern of five brain regions, which are related to working memory, attention, and language processing---all processes that fit well to our understanding of program comprehension. Our results encourage us and, hopefully, other researchers to use fMRI in future studies to measure program comprehension and, in the long run, answer questions, such as: Can we predict whether someone will be an excellent programmer? How effective are new languages and tools for program understanding? How should we train programmers?},
